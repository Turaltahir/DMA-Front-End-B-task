            <p>Popularly known as the ‘Father of the Digital World’, Steve Jobs an American entrepreneur, investor,
                co-founder of Apple Inc. Not the one to be satisfied with a single achievement, he moved on to make
                history in the world of consumer electronics with his foray into the music and cellular industry. The
                founder of Apple Inc, Pixar Animation Studios and NeXT Inc, Jobs gave information technology its life
                and blood. A master of innovation, he was known for his perfectionist attitude and futuristic vision. He
                foresaw trend in the field of information technology and worked hard to embrace the same in his line of
                products. With about 346 US patents by his side, Steve Jobs created a revolution in his field with his
                novel ideas and unique concepts. During his years at the Apple, he administered the development of the
                iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He was the mastermind behind the working of the company's Apple
                Retail Stores, iTunes Store and the App Store. Interestingly, with so much to fall back upon, it is
                quite amusing to know that this legendary innovator was not much educated, in fact a college dropout.
